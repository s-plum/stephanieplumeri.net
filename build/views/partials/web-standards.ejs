		<h1>This site layout looks "broken". Why?</h1>
		<p>If you saw this message on any of page on this site, then you are viewing the site in an outdated browser that is either "dead" (having dropped to make up less than 5% of <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201404-201409-bar" data-url="http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-{0}-{1}-bar">global browser market share</a>) or dying. Chances are, you are using Internet Explorer 8, or a newer browser running in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_View">compatibility mode</a>. It's okay, I forgive you.</p>
		<p>This site was built using modern web development techniques, including CSS3 for styling, media queries for responsive layouts, and jQuery matchMedia for added functionality. Unfortunately, older browsers don't support all of these tools, which means some things may look a little "wonky" (a very technical development term).</p>
		<p>Does this mean that I am a terrible web developer, and that I should be burned at the virual stake because my site is not pixel-perfect on older browsers?</p>
		<p>Absolutely not.</p>
		<p>Things may look a little "off", but you can still read all of the text, click all of the links, and admire all of the images on this site. I may not be a fan of your choice of browser, but I'm not about to cut you off from all of my site content because of it. The other bells and whistles that you may not be able to see are an enhancement on the baseline content that you can access. You can view these extras on a more modern, standards-compliant browser.</p>
